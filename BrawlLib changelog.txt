http://forums.kc-mm.com/index.php?topic=17547.0

The TextureConverterDialog has one added property - "InitialSize" - which is a
System.Drawing.Size object, defaulting to null. If it's not null, the dialog
will auto-set the "resize" dimensions when it opens up.

There is also a new setting in the BrawlLib assembly: HideMDL0Errors.
Set this to "true" to hide the popup boxes on model errors.
